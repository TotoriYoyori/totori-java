Variable is a container to assign a category to values and use them later. Values can be both numbers and strings. 

Three ways of creating variables:
  let variableName = a;
    Creates a variable with the name 'variableName'. Values assigned to it can be changed later with reassignments.
      example: let cartQuantity = 3;

  const variableName = a;
    Create a constant variable with the name 'x'. Values assigned to be it cannot changed later with reassignments.  
    >> Best practice to always start with const variableName becaues it is safer and cannot be changed. 
      example: const cartQuantity = 3;

  var [x] = a;
    Same as let [x] = a;

Reassigning variables:
  [x] = a;
    Where [x] is the variable name and a is the new value. 

Shortcuts for reassignments of variables:
  [x] += a 
  [x] -= a
  [x] *= a
  [x] /= a
They will shift the numerical value of a variable by 'a'.
  [x] ++
  [x] --
Specifically to shift value of a variable by 1. 

Naming conventions for variables:
  camelCase = cartQuantity
  PascalCase = CartQuantity
  kebab-case = cart-quantity
  snake_case = cart_quantity

You can box lines of buttons together in HTML by compouding <button> inside a <p> elements
  example:
  <p>
    <button> a </button>
    <button> b </button>
  </p>

Converting string into maths:
  eval(x); 
  where x stands for the variable containing the string to be converted into math.
    example:
    let calc = '1+1';
    eval (calc);
